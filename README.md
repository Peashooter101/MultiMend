# MultiMend

***Your Mending, your way!*** *(not stolen from a cool server)*

## Why MultiMend?

One of the biggest issues with Mending is how overpowered it is.
Many servers have tried to fix the issue by removing Villagers, Mending, etc.

This is an attempt to keep Mending in the game while making it much more manageable!

## Features

- **Random Chance**: Mending can be configured to mend randomly rather than 100% of the time.
    - Can make this random chance increase with Mending Level, meaning levels actually can mean something!
- **Multiplier**: Mending can be configured to give more or less overall relative to the Base XP.
- **Bonuses**: Mending can have flat bonuses added onto it!
  - Can make this bonus increase with Mending Level!
  - Bonuses can use a multiplier per level or a flat increase!
